# Movies
You will need to create an iOS app, preferentially in Swift, using the last version of Xcode. This app should show a catalog of the most popular movies on Trakt library, where the user should be able to search for some specific movie. The user also should be able to refresh this catalog whenever he wants. The movie in catalog should show its name, release year and image.
